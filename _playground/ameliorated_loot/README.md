# Ameliorated Loot

Modifies almost all vanilla loot tables to provide loot more in line with the core principles.

## Loot appropriate to structure

This means I did my best to make sure that loot found within a structure matches what would be going on in that structure. For instance, within mineshafts chests will contain miner tools, candles, ores and the like.

### Loot is always improved by the looting effect

Yep. Every mob killed by a sword with Looting comes with an improved drop.

### Loot is always improved by player luck

Your player legit has a luck attribute. It now plays into all loot tables.

### Starter/Bonus Chest

Contains only a stone_axe and 3 white_wool

### Fishing

Most of the time fishing will result in fish or ocean trash. The fish returned will be those found in the current biome.

Junk is pretty junky. Treasure is extremely rare without luck_of_the_sea or high luck.

### Pyramid Chest

I treated these like sarcophagi, so within each will be bones and rotten flesh OR it may spawn a Husk.

Additionally the player may find things like honey_bottles, gold_nuggets, latterns, banners, filled_maps, lapis_lazuli, feathers and more. With luck they may discover enchanted books, emeralds, golden apples, golden armors, and more.
