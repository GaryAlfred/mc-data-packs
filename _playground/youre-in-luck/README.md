# You're In Luck

This data pack adds a bit of luck to your game through achievements and recipes.

## Blarney the Lucky Pig

Blarney is a pig that runs extra fast. Blarney spawns after the player has fed pigs 40 times. Punching Blarney causes it to drop loot 7 times at which point it disappears dropping the Blarney Stone. Hitting Blarney with a weapon causes it to disappear without dropping anything. The first 6 drops are 1-3(2-5) gold_nuggets. The 7th drop is the Blarney Stone that can be used to permanently raise the player's luck by 1 (see Below).
